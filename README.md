# AI Virtual Mouse and Real-Time Object Distance Measurement
The AI Virtual Mouse and Real-Time Object Distance Measurement project integrates advanced computer vision and machine learning to deliver a dual-purpose application that enhances user interaction and measurement capabilities. This Python-based solution uses a webcam to enable hands-free control of a computer mouse through intuitive hand gestures, while simultaneously offering precise, real-time measurements of distances between objects in its field of view. Designed to simplify tasks and improve accessibility, the application is particularly beneficial in fields like automation, robotics, accessibility technology, and education.

With the gesture-controlled mouse, users can navigate the cursor by simply moving their hand in front of the camera and perform left or right clicks using predefined gestures, eliminating the need for physical contact with the mouse. This feature is ideal for accessibility purposes and interactive systems. The distance measurement module calculates distances between objects in real-time, adapting dynamically to different object sizes and distances, making it suitable for industrial automation, surveillance systems, and robotic applications.
